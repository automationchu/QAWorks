I decided to change the Feature file a wee bit (my apologies for being presumptuous).
The reason being for the change was to separate the code functionality from the 'Then' step, and use the
'Then' step to perform some assertions. Hence, I added an extra step prior that would handle the data table
functionality. Also I added an extra step to show that the user clicks on the Contact link.

As this feature file is complementary to the Agile Methodology, this file is also seen as a form of 
documentation. I find that when creating an acceptance test from the acceptance criteria, it is essential 
for the criteria to be clear and unambiguous. Again, let me apologise (this is not a misguided attempt to be 'cocky')
, I am just trying to cover all angles as regards the scope of this exercise.

The bugs that I noticed were the following:

1. The name field accepted 'j.Bloggs' as a valid name. There should be extra functionality to check that the name
is actually valid. If not, it should return a text message to the user to input a valid name. 

2. The user has no confirmation that their input details have been accepted by the QAWorks website.
this could result in a user inputting their details several times over. Not good!

I did the best I could with the assertions based upon the business logic of the Contact Page.
The submit button would be disabled until all three fields had been populated.
